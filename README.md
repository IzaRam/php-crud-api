# REST API with PHP and MySQL

A REST API that supports GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests and allow you to perform CRUD operations against a MySQL database to create, read, update and delete records from a database.

A simple PHP script that connects to a MySQL database and listens to API requests then responds accordingly by either fetching and returning data from the SQL table or insert, update and delete data from the database.
